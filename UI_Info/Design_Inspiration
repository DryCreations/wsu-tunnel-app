The User Interface was designed to feel both familiar and functional.  The design pulls its inspiration from many common mobile applications.  It has a static header and footer with dynamic content in the middle.  Additional content is brought into view by means of a side loading menu.  The UI also utilizes swipe navgation to move between the map screen and additional internal pages i.e. FAQ, and About.
